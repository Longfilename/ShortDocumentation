# Short Documentation (Yeoman Generator)

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for the [Short Documentation](https://longfilename.github.io/generator-short-documentation/) project.

Short Documentation is an HTML template &amp; documentation project.

The code organization and naming convention allow for a documentation build with minimal effort. Short Documentation uses `Pug`, `SCSS`, and `TypeScript`, and uses a configuration file to jump start project development (by building out all the files and folders as defined in the `JSON` file).
